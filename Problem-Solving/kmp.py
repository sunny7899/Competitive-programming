# Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) for String Matching
# Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm  used  for finding sub string.
# in this we reduce the iteration on pattern.
# complexity  O(n+m)
# Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm or Boyer-Moore String Search algorithm is faster single pattern string searching algorithm, than Rabin-Karp

# application
# when we Ctrl+F a keyword in a document, we perform pattern matching in the whole document.
